the lids off the food for Daddy” or “Put your hoods up, children.
Daddy's about to cut his meat”. Of course, this is only when I am
flying with my family. When I am on my own, I don’t eat, drink or
lean over to tie my shoelaces, and never put a pen anywhere near
my mouth. I just sit very, very quietly, sometimes on my hands to
keep them from flying out unexpectedly and causing liquid
mischief. It’s not much fun, but it does at least cut down on
the laundry bills.
I never did get my frequent flyer miles, by the way. I never do.
I couldn't find the card in time. This has become a real frustration
for me. Everyone I know — everyone— is forever flying off to Bali
first class with their air miles. I never get to collect anything. I
must fly 100,000 miles a year, yet I have accumulated only about
212 air miles divided between twenty-three airlines.
This is because either I forget to ask for the air miles when I
check in, or I remember to ask for them but the airline then
manages not to record them, or the check-in clerkutensils from the shelter.
Then they deputed the
children to lie in the sand
left by the waters around
the shelter with these
utensils on their stomachs,
to communicate to the
passing helicopters that they
were hungry. The message
got through, and after that
the helicopter made regular
rounds of the shelter,
airdropping food and other
basic needs.
Prashant found that a
large number of children had
been orphaned. He brought
them together and put up a
polythene sheet shelter for
them. Women were mobilised
to look after them, while the
men secured food and
materials for the shelter.
As the weeks passed,
Prashant was quick to
recognise that the women
and children were sinking
deeper and deeper in their
grief. He persuaded the women to start working in the food-forwork
programme started by an NGO, and for the children he
organised sports events. He himself loved to play cricket, and so
he organised cricket matches for children. Prashant engaged,
with other volunteers, inutensils from the shelter.
